A collection of Lua scripts for the OpenComputers-Mod for Minecraft.
Scripts are categorized in folders based on 

* The **entity** they're written for (`computer`, `drone`, `robot`...) 
* Their associated **projects**, if they work in conjunction with one or more other scripts to achieve a task
  (`ae`, `holo_hud`, `security`...)
* Whether they are considered **libraries** (`lib`)
  
## Running the scripts
Scripts are in different stages of being developed, but newer ones will have their requirements in a comment-header-block
in the file itself or, if part of a project, in a `README.md` in that file.

## Disclaimer
Currently, I am making no commitment towards maintaining any of the scripts in this repository, so there are no 
guarantees concerning the quality and completeness of the scripts or if they still work in newer versions of OpenComputers.

Feel free to fork and/or modify and release any of them yourself, as long as you comply with the license (GPL v3).

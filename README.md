# OpenComputers-Scripts
Lua scripts for the OpenComputers-Mod for Minecraft

You can find the OpenComputers mod at https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers;

Button_Api.lua was originally coded by Direwolf20 and was ported to OC by MoparDan;

Table-Save.lua from http://lua-users.org/wiki/SaveTableToFile;

Some scripts are/will be added to and will be further developed at https://github.com/GlobalEmpire/OC-Programs although 
I will try to push major changes to this repo for convenience and to keep this as a collection of my personal scripts
